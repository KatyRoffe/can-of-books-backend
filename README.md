# Can of Books (Backend)

**Author**: Eddie Ponce & Katy Roffe
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

This application is designed to create a web app to track what books have impacted us and book recommendations. We will connect a front-end React app to a back-end Express server, which will connect to MongoDB.

## Getting Started

Resources:

### Logistical

* What hours will you be available to communicate?
  * 8:00am – 10:00pm
* What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  * Slack
* How often will you take breaks?
  * Whenever needed but we’ll shoot for a minimum of at least once every two hours
* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  * Identify our MVP’s and prioritize those accordingly. If need, we will bring in a TA for assistance.

### Cooperative

* Make a list of each person’s strengths.
  * Eddie: CSS and front-end JavaScript
  * Katy: CSS, and organization
* How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  * Eddie will likely cover down on the front-end but help with back-end when needed.
  * Katy will likely cover down on back-end but help with front end when needed.
* In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  * We’d both like to improve our JavaScript skills.
* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  * We will conduct the Driver & Navigator Pair Programming  method and ensure we approach each problem one step at a time.
  
### Conflict Resolution

* What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  * Speak up to our partners and if the issue persists, let an instructor know.
* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  * Same as above.
* How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  * Make efforts to communicate clearly and to help with any questions regarding our code. Come in with a healthy dose of patience and understanding.
